# Contributing

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to Rehooks, you'll need to clone the repository and install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/rehooks/rehooks.git
cd rehooks
pnpm install
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure to install the dependencies using the correct package manager, which
  is pnpm in our monorepo.
</Callout>

## CLI

You are not able to publish the CLI to NPM, but you can use it locally. To do this, you must run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
cd packages/cli
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Package

You can use the package to use in monorepo internally. Head over to the `packages/core` folder and run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
cd packages/core
pnpm build
```

## Docs

First, let's take a look at the structure of the docs:

<Files>
  <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="app"></Folder>
    <Folder name="components"></Folder>
    <Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="hooks" defaultOpen>
        <File name="useThrottle.mdx" />
        <File name="useFetch.mdx" />
      </Folder>
      <File name="index.mdx" />
      <File name="guide.mdx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

### App

The `app` folder contains the main application of the docs. It is a Next.js application that uses the `fumadocs-ui` to render the docs.

### Content

The `content` folder contains the content of the docs. It is divided into two routes: `/docs` and `/docs/hooks`.
`/docs`: This route contains the basic information about Rehooks, including Introduction, API Reference, Guide and Contributing for sure.
`/docs/hooks`: This route contains the docs of the hooks which is accessible via CLI.
